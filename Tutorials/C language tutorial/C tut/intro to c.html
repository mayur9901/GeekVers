    <h1>C Introduction</h1>
    <h2>What is C?</h2>
    <p>
        C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.It is avery popular language, despite being old.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Should We Learn C?</h2>
    <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>
    <p>
        So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    int a = 10;
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}            
    </pre>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>10</p>
